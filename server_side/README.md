## Server Overview

Backend scaffold for Four-in-a-Row. Currently only the Go module definition exists (module `4_rows_backend`, Go 1.25.4). Application code/endpoints are not yet implemented.

## Getting Started

- Ensure Go 1.25.4 (or newer compatible) is available.
- This folder is a stub; add handlers, routing, and API surface as needed.

## Suggested Next Steps

- Define API contract (moves, game state, matchmaking if desired).
- Add HTTP server setup (e.g., net/http or a small router) and CORS for the client.
- Implement game logic and persistence if multiplayer or history is planned.
